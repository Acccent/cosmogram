When a friend of mine recently linked me to an article detailing a game designer's conversion from NFT skeptic to (I quote) "full blown crypto-bro," my first reaction was to roll my eyes. "You have to at least take a look at their arguments," my friend said, and so I reluctantly did go through the whole thing. You can do so as well [here](https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/blog/2021/10/9/5-reasons-why-i-am-bullish-on-blockchain-gaming), should you wish to, but I'm not going to ask you to and I would certainly forgive you if you gave up on it halfway through; it was physically taxing for me to get to the end.
