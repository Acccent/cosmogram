In November of 2021, [Osama Dorias](https://twitter.com/osamadorias), [Liz England](https://twitter.com/lizardengland) and [Sam Boucher](https://twitter.com/MonsieurEureka) organised a game jam (slash social experiment, slash communal design performance) titled "How many designers does it take to create a card game?"

I was invited, along with 99 other designers, to create a single card which would, along with the 99 other cards, form a deck to be used in a very chaotic game. Basically the only things I knew when I started designing the card was that:

1. All cards would be shuffled into a shared deck from which players would draw 5 cards;
2. A turn simply involves playing up to 2 cards (following the instructions on the cards), then drawing back up to 5;
3. Cards played are placed in front of the player and remain there, unless stated otherwise.

You can read more about the project and see all the submissions [here](http://howmanydesignersdoesittake.com). Below, I'll talk a bit about my own card, the Pensive Lady.

*Card rules: Whenever another player discards one of their cards, you may instead place it face-down under Pensive Lady. (If Pensive Lady is discarded, all cards under it return to the discard zone.) When you place the 12th card under Pensive Lady, the game ends. Then, read the players' fortunes in the 12 cards, to ascertain the winner.*

When I started thinking about the project and what I would do for my card, I knew that I wanted to integrate elements of other card games, but not the kind that game designers often like to play and discuss (ie. MtG and the like). Instead, I was thinking of classic games like Hearts – which has always been a personal favourite of mine –, as well as Tarot and other forms of divination.

#### Mechanics

I started with the rules. The main goal was to evoke the Black Lady variant of Hearts, in which a player can attempt to "shoot the moon": take all the spades, which you normally want to avoid (including the "Black Lady" herself, the Queen of Spades.) If they do so, they take 0 penalty points, while giving 26 (the maximum penalty) to all the other players. This creates a dynamic where a player has to hide that they're attempting to shoot the moon, lest an opponent prevents them from doing so; there's a slow crawl towards victory, with an increasing risk of failing and taking a huge penalty. When you do manage to shoot the moon though, the reward is all the more satisfying.

The Pensive Lady mechanically mimics the act of trick-taking (just like when winning a trick, you take cards from your opponents and place them face-down in front of you) and the gradual progress towards a big reward, which other players have to counter before it's too late. Additionally, the rules ask for 12 cards, creating a stack of 13 cards when counting the Pensive Lady herself – the Queen of Spades is worth 13 penalty points in a game of Black Lady. Not knowing any of the other cards, I didn't know how often players would play 2 cards in a turn (instead of one), but requiring 12 cards meant a minimum of two full rounds would need to pass before the victory condition could be achieved (barring any combos), which seemed like a reasonable amount of reaction time for opponents.

The last aspect I considered when designing the card was its "playability" – I assumed that most cards in the game would feature complex rules (us game designers can't help ourselves), and wanted to limit the amount of in-game reading and manipulation needed as much as I could.

Thematically, the card pays homage to the French tradition of divination, as seen here for instance: https://www.wopc.co.uk/france/livre-du-destin
The main illustration is from J. J. Grandville, a renowned French illustrator and cartoonist from the early 19th century whose style is reproduced on many French tarot cards.
The title can be interpreted as a description of a widow, the archetype traditionally associated with the Queen of Spades in French fortune-telling cards, or as a nod to Pallas Athena, the goddess of Wisdom and the Queen of Spades herself in the "portrait officiel" style of playing cards. Of course, it's also simply a reference to the actual scene depicted on the card: a woman dreaming of becoming a queen.

The last line of the card rules combines these two aspects in a subversion of conventional victory conditions: the player is given agency to interpret how a fortune reading might be performed, and then can decide who the winner is, if there even is one.
