In November of 2021, [Osama Dorias](https://twitter.com/osamadorias), [Liz England](https://twitter.com/lizardengland) and [Sam Boucher](https://twitter.com/MonsieurEureka) organised a game jam (slash social experiment, slash communal design performance) titled "How many designers does it take to create a card game?"

I was invited, along with 99 other designers, to create a single card which would, along with the 99 other cards, form a deck to be used in a very chaotic game. Basically the only things I knew when I started designing the card was that:

1. All cards would be shuffled into a shared deck from which players would draw 5 cards;
2. A turn simply involves playing up to 2 cards (following the instructions on the cards), then drawing back up to 5;
3. Cards played are placed in front of the player and remain there, unless stated otherwise.

You can read more about the project and see all the submissions [here](http://howmanydesignersdoesittake.com). Below, I'll talk a bit about my own card, the Pensive Lady.

*Card rules: Whenever another player discards one of their cards, you may instead place it face-down under Pensive Lady. (If Pensive Lady is discarded, all cards under it return to the discard zone.) When you place the 12th card under Pensive Lady, the game ends. Then, read the players' fortunes in the 12 cards, to ascertain the winner.*

When I started thinking about the project and what I would do for my card, I knew that I wanted to integrate elements of other card games, but not the kind that game designers often like to play and discuss (ie. MtG and the like). Instead, I was thinking of classic games like Hearts, as well as Tarot and other forms of divination.
