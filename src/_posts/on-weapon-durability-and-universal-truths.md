A few days ago, Nintendo dropped a new trailer for the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel ([here](https://youtu.be/Pi-MRZBP91I)). I haven't watched it myself, so I'm not sure if something in the trailer triggered what followed, or if it was just a matter of planetary alignment, but in any case, it did happen: *weapon degradation discourse on twitter*. Obviously I joined in because I can never shut the fuck up.

I don't like it! And well... who cares, right? It's just a game system. But strangely, whenever this particular topic is brought up, there's a whole range of people who will proclaim that they *do* like it, and that not liking it is an unequivocal demonstration of one's incapability to grasp the subtleties of game design.\
(To anyone reading this who tweeted something along the lines of '*weapon degradation is good actually and if you can't see why you're a chump*': I get it. this is twitter. what are you gonna do, post a nuanced take?)

Anyway, because it's a system that can seem frustrating on the surface, it's only natural for anyone whose identity is founded in part on 'thinking about stuff' to dismiss that first layer and assume the opposite must be true, and in one fell swoop, to also dismiss differing opinions. So for the sake of this discussion let's go ahead and acknowledge that a multitude of *actually thought-out* opinions can coexist, opposite of each other but on equal levels.

I'll go back to that in a bit, but first let's chat about the actual design problem at hand!

## How can my shield breaking be good?

* it enables fluctuations of pace and power balance as the player goes from a wooden stick to a massive halberd, then back to a stick;
* it encourages experimentation, since players can't get too attached to a single weapon;
* it creates another reward for exploration and engagement with monsters: a Lynel's sword is now not only intimidating, it's also alluring;
* it's funny when you chuck a legendary sword at a goblin and it explodes.

Also, and quite notably, it really fits the overall theme and tone of the game! This is something that's rarely brought up but it's super true. Everything is falling apart in that version of Hyrule, it only makes sense that the weapons are as well.

### But Robin I thought you said you didn't like the system?

I don't! Because all four points above are actually highly dependant on the player's personality and approach to play.

For me, weapon degradability often:

* prevents fluctuations in power balance as I stash powerful weapons away for later encounters (which may never come);
* discourages experimentation by telling me I shouldn't mess around with powerful weapons when I'm not in a critical situation;
* suggests I should avoid exploration, because it might leave me stranded with no useful weapon or decrease their durability on optional encounters;
* entirely negates the weapon throwing mechanic - why would I ever do that when weapons are a finite resource?

People often say that degradability forces players to engage with the game's combat when they would otherwise stick to the safest, most optimal option throughout the game. That is true *for some players*. I naturally have a tendency to explore a game's world and possibility space, but this system takes that away from me. Without it, I would have swapped weapons all the time, wandered freely off the main path, juggled with the tools offered to me - a two-way relationship between the designers and the player.

The very fact that a system exists creates a strange anxiety that would otherwise not burden my playstyle, a sort of quantum irk where I am annoyed both that I can't just switch weapons with no consequence and that my inventory has become an unmanageable mess.

### You're just not engaging with the game on its terms
